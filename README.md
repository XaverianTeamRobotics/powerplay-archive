# Welcome!

This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot for Hawks Robotics: The Ryken Force.

## Getting Started

If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) to get familiar with how to use the control system, and from there migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial).

Once you have an understanding of the core FTC mechanics under the hood, we recommend using Android Studio. [Check out our onboarding guide](https://xaverianteamrobotics.github.io/FtcRobotController/onboarding) to learn how to get set up with Android Studio and make sure to read other parts of our team documentation to understand the differences between coding with FTC provided tools and with our tools.
