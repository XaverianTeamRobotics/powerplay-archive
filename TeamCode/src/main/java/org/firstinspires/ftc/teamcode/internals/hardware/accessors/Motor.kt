/**
 * A motor is a big thing that can rotate and drive things. Note that driving to a position is not supported by this API, and that's very much by design. The internal encoder and PID controller of motors both have a horribly low resolution, and thus should never be used when attempting to precisely drive to a position. Use an external encoder and write a custom PID loop for this functionality instead. If absolutely necessary, you can still use the motor's internal position driver via the internal motor accessor in this class.
