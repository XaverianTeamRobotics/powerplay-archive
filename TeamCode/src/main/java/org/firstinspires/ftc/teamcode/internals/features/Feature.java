/**
 * A feature is a type of jlooping script. Like any script, features can be added to a runner at any time and will execute normally in the runner. According to their name, features are designed to be specific features&mdash;not an entire replacement for an {@link OperationMode}. When features are in use, OpModes should add them to the runner in {@link OperationMode#construct()} via {@link OperationMode#registerFeature(Feature)} and the features should take care of operation of their specific tasks. Features can implement the {@link Buildable} interface to mimick {@link OperationMode#construct()}, and {@link Conditional} to only execute when their {@link Conditional#when()} method returns true. State machines are encouraged to be created via conditional features rather than a switch statement or if/else chain.
