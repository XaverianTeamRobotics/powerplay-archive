/*
 * This allows for the driver station to remind the driver of the next best objective.
 * The data will be displayed via telemetry
 * And the data to display will be obtained from https://github.com/XaverianTeamRobotics/scoring-simulator (made by Michael L)
 * This tool is essentially our strategic AI, and it uses a Monte Carlo method to determine the best moves.
 * Sort of like a chess bot, but better.
